# Documentation
This section is intended to familiarise users with the documentation environment and to provide a first detailed insight into the FMI.jl library.
## Documentation Overview
### 1. Introduction
- ***Prior knowledge***  
  
  In order to better understand the functionality of the library, a brief explanation of the most important terms is advantageous. Fundamental terms that are important to understand are `FMI` and `FMU`.  
- ***Library FMI.jl***  
  
  describes important `properties` of the library and is intended to `answer initial questions`.

### FMI
The Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) is an open standard for the tool-independent exchange and integration of track models from different manufactures. FMI simplifies the use of the best tools for specific modeling tasks and the consistent reuse of models in different development phases and across departmental boundaries. This way you can choose the most suitable tool for each type of analysis while keeping the same model.

### FMU

## Library FMI.jl
FMI.jl is a free-to-use software library for the Julia programming language, which integrates FMI ([fmi-standard.org](http://fmi-standard.org/)): load, instantiate, parameterize and simulate FMUs seamlessly inside the Julia programming language!







## What is FMI.jl?
FMI.jl is a free-to-use software library for the Julia programming language, which integrates FMI ([fmi-standard.org](http://fmi-standard.org/)): load, instantiate, parameterize and simulate FMUs seamlessly inside the Julia programming language!

## How can I install FMI.jl?
1. open a Julia-Command-Window, activate your preferred environment
1. go to package manager using ```]``` and type ```add FMI```
```julia
julia> ]

(@v1.6) pkg> add FMI
```

If you want to check that everything works correctly, you can run the tests bundled with FMI.jl:
```julia
julia> using Pkg

julia> Pkg.test("FMI")
```

Additionally, you can check the version of FMI.jl that you have installed with the ```status``` command.
```julia
julia> ]
(@v1.6) pkg> status FMI
```

Throughout the rest of the tutorial we assume that you have installed the FMI.jl package and have typed ```using FMI``` which loads the package:

```julia
julia> using FMI
```

## How the documentation is structured?
Having a high-level overview of how this documentation is structured will help you know where to look for certain things. The xxx main parts of the documentation are :
- The __Tutorials__ section explains all the necessary steps to work with the library.
- The __examples__ section gives insight in what is possible with this Library while using short and easily understandable code snippets
- The __library functions__ sections contains all the documentation to the functions provided by this library

## What is currently supported in FMI.jl?
- simulation / plotting of CS- and ME-FMUs
- event-handling for discontinuous ME-FMUs
- the full FMI command set

## What is under development in FMI.jl?
- FMI 3.0 and SSP 1.0 support
- FMI Cross Checks
- more examples
- ...

## What Platforms are supported?
FMI.jl is tested (and testing) under Julia Version 1.6 and latest on Windows (latest) and Ubuntu (latest). Mac should work, but untested.
