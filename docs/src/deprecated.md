# deprecated Functions

this doc page is necessary as all exported functions must be documented in the manual with documenter configured to check for missing documentation, therefor this hidden page exists

### internal functions: remove export?
```@docs
fmi2CallbackFunctions
```

### deprecated
Mostly wrappers that are not supposed to be used (call specific wrapped functions instead)

all gone since 0.14.0 (nice)
```@docs
```
