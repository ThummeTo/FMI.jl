    "## Introduction to the example\n",
    "This example shows how to overwrite a FMI function with a custom C-function. For this the FMU model is simulated first without changes. Then the function `fmi2GetReal()` is overwritten and simulated again. Both simulations are displayed in a graph to show the change caused by overwriting the function. The model used is a one-dimensional spring pendulum with friction. The object-orientated structure of the *SpringFrictionPendulum1D* can be seen in the following graphic.\n",
