FMI (Functional Mock-up Interface) is a free standard (fmi-standard.org) that defines a container and an interface to exchange dynamic models using a combination of XML files, binaries and C code zipped into a single file. The user can thus use simulation models in the form of an FMU (Functional Mock-up Units). Besides loading the FMU, the user can also set values for parameters and states and simulate the FMU both as co-simulation and model exchange simulation.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/manipulation/#Introduction-to-the-example","page":"Manipulation","title":"Introduction to the example","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"examples/manipulation/","page":"Manipulation","title":"Manipulation","text":"This example shows how to overwrite a library function with an own function.

FMI (Functional Mock-up Interface) is a free standard (fmi-standard.org) that defines a container and an interface to exchange dynamic models using a combination of XML files, binaries and C code zipped into a single file. The user can thus use simulation models in the form of an FMU (Functional Mock-up Units). Besides loading the FMU, the user can also set values for parameters and states and simulate the FMU both as co-simulation and model exchange simulation.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/multiple_instances/#Introduction-to-the-example","page":"Multiple instances","title":"Introduction to the example","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"examples/multiple_instances/","page":"Multiple instances","title":"Multiple instances","text":"In this example we want to show that it is possible to create different instances of an FMU.

Here the FMI specification is implemented. FMI (Functional Mock-up Interface) is a free standard (fmi-standard.org) that defines a container and an interface to exchange dynamic models using a combination of XML files, binaries and C code zipped into a single file. The user can thus use simulation models in the form of an FMU (Functional Mock-up Units). Besides loading the FMU, the user can also set values for parameters and states and simulate the FMU both as co-simulation and model exchange simulation.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/simulate/#Introduction-to-the-example","page":"Simulate","title":"Introduction to the example","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"examples/simulate/","page":"Simulate","title":"Simulate","text":"In this example we want to show how fast and easy the simulation for an FMU is.
