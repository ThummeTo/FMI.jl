This section discusses the included examples of the FMI.jl library. So you can execute them on your machine and get detailed information about all the steps. If you require further information about the function calls, see [library](@ref library) or [fmu2](@ref fmu2) function sections.

The examples are:

- __Simulate__: Showing how you can simulate a CS-FMU and a ME-FMU.
- __Parameterize__: A short example explaining how to parameterize a FMU before simulation.
- __Multiple instances__: Showing the use of multiple instances.
- __Modelica conference 2021__: Showing the different variants of simulating an FMU.
- __Manipulation__: Showing how to redefine a library function.
