## Introduction to the example
FMUs can be simulated in multiple ways using *FMI.jl*. You can use a very simple interface, that offers possibilities that satisfy almost any user requirement. However, if you need to build a custom simulation loop for your use case using the core FMI functions, we show that too.

## Other formats
Besides, this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/thummeto/FMI.jl/blob/examples/examples/jupyter-src/modelica_conference_2021.ipynb) there is also a [Julia file](https://github.com/thummeto/FMI.jl/blob/examples/examples/jupyter-src/modelica_conference_2021.jl) with the same name, which contains only the code cells and for the documentation there is a [Markdown file](https://github.com/thummeto/FMI.jl/blob/examples/examples/jupyter-src/modelica_conference_2021.md) corresponding to the notebook.  

## Code section

To run the example, the previously installed packages must be included. 


```julia
# imports
using FMI
using FMIZoo
using Plots
```

### Simulation setup

Next, the start time and end time of the simulation are set. Finally, a step size is specified to store the results of the simulation at these time steps.


```julia
tStart = 0.0
tStep = 0.1
tStop = 8.0
tSave = tStart:tStep:tStop
```




    0.0:0.1:8.0



### Simple FMU Simulation
Next, the FMU model from *FMIZoo.jl* is loaded and the information about the FMU is shown.


```julia
# we use an FMU from the FMIZoo.jl
fmu = loadFMU("SpringFrictionPendulum1D", "Dymola", "2022x")
info(fmu)
```

### Easy Simulation
In the next commands the FMU is simulated, for which the start and end time and recorded variables are declared. Afterwards the simulation result is plotted. In the plot for the FMU, it can be seen that the oscillation keeps decreasing due to the effect of friction. If one simulates long enough, the oscillation comes to a standstill after a certain time.


```julia
simData = simulate(fmu, (tStart, tStop); recordValues=["mass.s"], saveat=tSave)
plot(simData)
```




    
![svg](modelica_conference_2021_files/modelica_conference_2021_10_0.svg)
    



After plotting the data, the FMU is unloaded and all unpacked data on disc is removed.


```julia
unloadFMU(fmu)
```

### Custom Simulation

In the following type of simulation a more advanced variant is presented, which allows intervening more in the simulation process. Analogous to the simple variant, an FMU model must be loaded.


```julia
fmu = loadFMU("SpringFrictionPendulum1D", "Dymola", "2022x")
```




    Model name:	SpringFrictionPendulum1D
    Type:		1



Next, it is necessary to create an instance of the FMU, this is achieved by the command `fmi2Instantiate!()`.  


```julia
instanceFMU = fmi2Instantiate!(fmu)
```




    FMU:            SpringFrictionPendulum1D
        InstanceName:   SpringFrictionPendulum1D
        Address:        Ptr{Nothing} @0x0000019041ab9c70
        State:          0
        Logging:        false
        FMU time:       -Inf
        FMU states:     nothing



In the following code block, start and end time for the simulation is set by the `fmi2SetupExperiment()` command. Next, the FMU is initialized by the calls of `fmi2EnterInitializationMode()` and `fmi2ExitInitializationMode()`. It would also be possible to set initial states, parameters or inputs at this place in code.


```julia
fmi2SetupExperiment(instanceFMU, tStart, tStop)
# set initial model states
fmi2EnterInitializationMode(instanceFMU)
# get initial model states
fmi2ExitInitializationMode(instanceFMU)
```




    0x00000000



The actual simulation loop is shown in the following block. Here a simulation step `fmi2DoStep()` with the fixed step size `tStep` is executed. As indicated in the code by the comments, the input values and output values of the FMU could be changed in the simulation loop as desired, whereby the higher possibility of adjustments arises.


```julia
values = []

for t in tSave
    # set model inputs if any
    # ...

    fmi2DoStep(instanceFMU, tStep)
    
    # get model outputs
    value = fmi2GetReal(instanceFMU, "mass.s")
    push!(values, value)
end

plot(tSave, values)
```




    
![svg](modelica_conference_2021_files/modelica_conference_2021_20_0.svg)
    



The instantiated FMU must be terminated and then the memory area for the instance can also be deallocated. The last step is to unload the FMU to remove all unpacked data on disc. 


```julia
fmi2Terminate(instanceFMU)
fmi2FreeInstance!(instanceFMU)
unloadFMU(fmu)
```

### Summary

The tutorial has shown how to use the default simulation command and how to deploy a custom simulation loop.
