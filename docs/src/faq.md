This list some common - often numerical - errors, that can be fixed by better understanding the ODE-Problem inside your FMU.

----------

## Solving non-linear system failes
### Description
Error message or warning, that solving of a non-linear system failed, close to the simulation start time.

### Example
```
Solving non-linear system 101 failed at time=3e-05.
```

### Reason
This could be, because the first step of the integration is accepted by the solver's error estimation, but shouldn't. This is usually, if the first step is picked to large by the solver's start step size heuristics.

### Fix
- Try a small start value for the integration with keyword `dt`.

----------

## Access denied
### Description
Error message, that the binary for callback functions can't be accessed/opened.

### Example
```
ERROR:
could not load library "...\src\FMI2\callbackFunctions\binaries\win64\callbackFunctions.dll"
Access denied
```

### Reason
This is because your OS doesn't allow to interact with the binaries shipped with *FMI.jl*. 

### Fix
This can easily be solved by fixing the binary's permission options or is automatically fixed if Julia runs with admin privileges.

----------

## Double Callback Crossing
### Description
Error message, that solving failed because of `double callback crossing`.

### Example 
```
ERROR:
Double callback crossing floating pointer reducer errored. Report this issue.
```

### Reason
This is because the event instant (time point) of an FMU event indicator can't be found precisely.

### Fix
This can be solved by allowing for more interpolation points during searching of the zero crossing:
```
fmu.executionConfig.rootSearchInterpolationPoints = 1000 # default value is 10
```
This will have negative performance impact on systems with extreme amount of events (thousands per second). 
For systems with only a few events there won't be a noticable slow down.
