    "## Motivation\n",
    "This Julia Package *FMI.jl* is motivated by the use of simulation models in Julia. Here the FMI specification is implemented. FMI (*Functional Mock-up Interface*) is a free standard ([fmi-standard.org](http://fmi-standard.org/)) that defines a container and an interface to exchange dynamic models using a combination of XML files, binaries and C code zipped into a single file. The user can thus use simulation models in the form of an FMU (*Functional Mock-up Units*). Besides loading the FMU, the user can also set values for parameters and states and simulate the FMU both as co-simulation and model exchange simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to the example\n",
    "In this example we want to show that it is possible to create different instances of an FMU. The different instances can then be used to run independent simulations. After the FMU has been simulated, the simulation results are displayed in a graph. The used model is a one-dimensional spring pendulum without friction. The object-orientated structure of the *SpringPendulum1D* can be seen in the following graphic.\n",

    "![svg](https://github.com/thummeto/FMI.jl/blob/main/docs/src/examples/pics/SpringPendulum1D.svg?raw=true)  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target group\n",
    "The example is primarily intended for users who work in the field of simulations. The example wants to show how simple it is to use FMUs in Julia.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other formats\n",
    "Besides, this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/thummeto/FMI.jl/blob/examples/examples/src/multiple_instances.ipynb) there is also a [Julia file](https://github.com/thummeto/FMI.jl/blob/examples/examples/src/multiple_instances.jl) with the same name, which contains only the code cells and for the documentation there is a [Markdown file](https://github.com/thummeto/FMI.jl/blob/examples/examples/src/multiple_instances.md) corresponding to the notebook.  \n",
