# FMI.jl Documentation

## What is FMI.jl?
FMI.jl is a free-to-use software library for the Julia programming language, which integrates FMI ([fmi-standard.org](http://fmi-standard.org/)): load, instantiate, parameterize and simulate FMUs seamlessly inside the Julia programming language!

## How can I install FMI.jl?
1. open a Julia-Command-Window, activate your preferred environment
1. go to package manager using ```]``` and type ```add FMI```
```julia
julia> ]

(v.1.5.4)> add FMI
```

If you want to check that everything works correctly, you can run the tests bundled with FMI.jl:
```julia
julia> using Pkg

julia> Pkg.test("FMI")
```

Additionally, you can check the version of FMI.jl that you have installed with the ```status``` command.
```julia
julia> ]
(v.1.5.4)> status FMI
```

Throughout the rest of the tutorial we assume that you have installed the FMI.jl package and have typed ```using FMI``` which loads the package:

```julia
julia> using FMI
```
